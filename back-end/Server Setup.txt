# Digital Ocean seems to offer a good veriaty of perks virtual machines, web hosting, Database mangment using mysql,
# website hosting, and startup guides.
# Digital Ocean is parntered with Github Eduvcational giving $200 worth of credit for students which depending on how
# the pay periods fall and timing of the end of the class would give a least $50 a month budget.
# It can link directly to Github and poll from the repoosatory.
# They also allow us to create Droplets which are Virtual Machines with Mysql support.
# For set up I just need to email them a team invite and tehen they can set up their account.

# Rodrigo will have to create the Web app so that they can link the github reposatory to it. I have made him an owner
# so he should have permitions to do so. Looking through options the basic plan with 1GB ram should be enough for our
# needs (we ca discuss this when going over sprint 2) which runs $10 a month which we have the $200 from github eduction
# so should be fine. Guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYIiIZ2GvdM

# Under the database tab we can create and link a database to the web app. A database would is $15 dollars so again
# should be fine.
